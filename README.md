# teeworlds web map editor

This project is in very early development! And its not sure yet if it will ever be usuable!

I can highly recommend to have a look at [twwe](https://github.com/k2d222/twwe) instead!
It is a way more mature and performant teeworlds map editor.

### setup

    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

### run development server

    FLASK_ENV=development FLASK_APP=main.py flask run

Then goto http://localhost:5000/map in your browser
